### 23. Number of Unique Subjects Taught by Each Teacher

This problem involves calculating the number of distinct subjects each teacher teaches across all departments.

---

### Problem Requirements

1. **Input Table**:
   - **Teacher** table:
     - `teacher_id`: Unique identifier for each teacher.
     - `subject_id`: Unique identifier for each subject.
     - `dept_id`: Identifier for the department where the subject is taught.
     - **Primary Key**: `(subject_id, dept_id)`.

2. **Output**:
   - Each `teacher_id` and the count (`cnt`) of unique `subject_id` values they teach.

3. **Return Requirements**:
   - The result table can be in any order.

### Example

#### Input

| teacher_id | subject_id | dept_id |
|------------|------------|---------|
| 1          | 2          | 3       |
| 1          | 2          | 4       |
| 1          | 3          | 3       |
| 2          | 1          | 1       |
| 2          | 2          | 1       |
| 2          | 3          | 1       |
| 2          | 4          | 1       |

#### Output

| teacher_id | cnt |
|------------|-----|
| 1          | 2   |
| 2          | 4   |

#### Explanation

- **Teacher 1**:
  - Teaches subject 2 in departments 3 and 4 (counts as 1 unique subject).
  - Teaches subject 3 in department 3.
  - Total unique subjects: 2.

- **Teacher 2**:
  - Teaches subject 1, 2, 3, and 4 in department 1.
  - Total unique subjects: 4.

### SQL Solution

```sql
SELECT 
    teacher_id,
    COUNT(DISTINCT subject_id) AS cnt
FROM 
    Teacher
GROUP BY 
    teacher_id;
```

---

### Explanation of the Query

1. **Count Unique Subjects**:
   - Use `COUNT(DISTINCT subject_id)` to count unique `subject_id` values for each teacher.
   
2. **Group by Teacher**:
   - Use `GROUP BY teacher_id` to aggregate the results for each teacher.

---

### Key Points

- **DISTINCT**: Ensures duplicate subject entries across departments for the same teacher are not counted.
- **GROUP BY**: Groups the data by `teacher_id` to calculate unique counts per teacher.
