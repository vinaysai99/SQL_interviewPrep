### 25. Product Sales Analysis III

This problem involves finding the first year in which every product was sold, along with its corresponding details such as quantity and price.

---

### Problem Requirements

1. **Input Tables**:
   - **Sales** table:
     - `sale_id`: Unique identifier for each sale.
     - `product_id`: The product being sold.
     - `year`: Year of the sale.
     - `quantity`: Quantity sold in the sale.
     - `price`: Price per unit of the product.
   - **Product** table:
     - `product_id`: Unique identifier for each product.
     - `product_name`: Name of the product.

2. **Output**:
   - For each product, return:
     - `product_id`: The product's ID.
     - `first_year`: The first year the product was sold.
     - `quantity`: The quantity sold in the first year.
     - `price`: The price of the product in the first year.

3. **Conditions**:
   - The "first year" for a product is defined as the smallest year (`year`) in the `Sales` table for that product.

### Example

#### Input

**Sales Table**:

| sale_id | product_id | year | quantity | price |
|---------|------------|------|----------|-------|
| 1       | 100        | 2008 | 10       | 5000  |
| 2       | 100        | 2009 | 12       | 5000  |
| 7       | 200        | 2011 | 15       | 9000  |

**Product Table**:

| product_id | product_name |
|------------|--------------|
| 100        | Nokia        |
| 200        | Apple        |
| 300        | Samsung      |

#### Output

| product_id | first_year | quantity | price |
|------------|------------|----------|-------|
| 100        | 2008       | 10       | 5000  |
| 200        | 2011       | 15       | 9000  |

### SQL Solution

```sql
SELECT 
    product_id,
    year AS first_year,
    quantity,
    price
FROM 
    Sales
WHERE 
    (product_id, year) IN (
        SELECT 
            product_id,
            MIN(year) AS first_year
        FROM 
            Sales
        GROUP BY 
            product_id
    );
```

### Explanation

1. **Subquery to Find First Year**:
   - The subquery:
     ```sql
     SELECT 
         product_id,
         MIN(year) AS first_year
     FROM 
         Sales
     GROUP BY 
         product_id;
     ```
     groups the `Sales` table by `product_id` and finds the earliest year (`MIN(year)`) for each product.

2. **Join with the Main Query**:
   - The main query filters the `Sales` table to only include rows corresponding to the first year for each product by using a `(product_id, year)` condition.

3. **Columns in the Result**:
   - The `product_id`, `year` (renamed as `first_year`), `quantity`, and `price` are directly selected for the rows meeting the first-year condition.

4. **Result Order**:
   - The problem allows the output in any order, so no explicit sorting is required.

### Key Points

- **Efficient Filtering**:
  - The subquery ensures only the first year of data is selected for each product, avoiding the need for complex joins or additional filtering logic.
  
- **Grouping**:
  - The `GROUP BY product_id` ensures the aggregation (`MIN(year)`) is calculated separately for each product.
