### 46. Delete Duplicate Emails

The task is to delete duplicate rows in the `Person` table based on the `email` column. For each duplicate, retain only the row with the smallest `id`.

---

### Problem Details

1. **Input**:
   - **Table: `Person`**
     - Columns:
       - `id`: Primary key (unique for each row).
       - `email`: Email address (duplicates possible).

2. **Output**:
   - The updated `Person` table where only one row for each unique email is retained, and it corresponds to the smallest `id`.

---

### SQL Solution

```sql
WITH CTE AS (
    SELECT 
        email,
        MIN(id) AS min_id
    FROM Person
    GROUP BY email
)
DELETE FROM Person
WHERE id NOT IN (
    SELECT min_id 
    FROM CTE
);
```

---

### Explanation

1. **Step 1 - Create a CTE**:
   - Use a Common Table Expression (CTE) to identify the smallest `id` for each `email`:
     ```sql
     SELECT email, MIN(id) AS min_id
     FROM Person
     GROUP BY email;
     ```

2. **Step 2 - Delete Duplicate Rows**:
   - Use the `NOT IN` condition to delete rows where the `id` is not in the list of `min_id` values:
     ```sql
     DELETE FROM Person
     WHERE id NOT IN (
         SELECT min_id 
         FROM CTE
     );
     ```

### Example Outputs

#### Example 1:

**Input**:

| id | email            |
|----|------------------|
| 1  | john@example.com |
| 2  | bob@example.com  |
| 3  | john@example.com |

**Output**:

| id | email            |
|----|------------------|
| 1  | john@example.com |
| 2  | bob@example.com  |

**Explanation**:
- The email `john@example.com` is duplicated. Only the row with `id = 1` is retained because it has the smallest `id`.

---

### Alternate Solutions

#### Without CTE:
```sql
DELETE FROM Person
WHERE id NOT IN (
    SELECT MIN(id)
    FROM Person
    GROUP BY email
);
```

#### Using `ROW_NUMBER`:
```sql
WITH RankedEmails AS (
    SELECT 
        id,
        ROW_NUMBER() OVER (PARTITION BY email ORDER BY id) AS row_num
    FROM Person
)
DELETE FROM Person
WHERE id IN (
    SELECT id 
    FROM RankedEmails
    WHERE row_num > 1
);
```
