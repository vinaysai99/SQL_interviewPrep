### **Problem Details**

#### **Input Table**

**`Activities` Table**:
| sell_date  | product     |
|------------|-------------|
| 2020-05-30 | Headphone   |
| 2020-06-01 | Pencil      |
| 2020-06-02 | Mask        |
| 2020-05-30 | Basketball  |
| 2020-06-01 | Bible       |
| 2020-06-02 | Mask        |
| 2020-05-30 | T-Shirt     |

---

#### **Output Table**

**Result Table**:
| sell_date  | num_sold | products                     |
|------------|----------|------------------------------|
| 2020-05-30 | 3        | Basketball,Headphone,T-shirt |
| 2020-06-01 | 2        | Bible,Pencil                 |
| 2020-06-02 | 1        | Mask                         |

### **Solution Approach**

1. **Find Unique Products**:
   - Use `DISTINCT` to ensure only unique products are considered for each date.

2. **Count Distinct Products**:
   - Use `COUNT(DISTINCT product)` to count the number of unique products sold for each date.

3. **Concatenate Product Names**:
   - Use `GROUP_CONCAT` to concatenate the product names.
   - Sort the product names lexicographically using `ORDER BY` within `GROUP_CONCAT`.
   - Specify a separator `','`.

4. **Group and Sort**:
   - Group by `sell_date` to aggregate results for each date.
   - Sort the result table by `sell_date`.

### **SQL Query**

```sql
SELECT 
    sell_date,
    COUNT(DISTINCT product) AS num_sold,
    GROUP_CONCAT(DISTINCT product ORDER BY product SEPARATOR ',') AS products
FROM 
    Activities
GROUP BY 
    sell_date
ORDER BY 
    sell_date;
```

---

### **Explanation of the Query**

1. **`COUNT(DISTINCT product)`**:
   - Counts the number of unique products for each date.

2. **`GROUP_CONCAT(DISTINCT product ORDER BY product SEPARATOR ',')`**:
   - Concatenates the distinct product names for each date, ordered lexicographically, with a comma separator.

3. **`GROUP BY sell_date`**:
   - Ensures the results are grouped by each `sell_date`.

4. **`ORDER BY sell_date`**:
   - Orders the final result by date.
