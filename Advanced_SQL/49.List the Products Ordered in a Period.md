### **Solution Approach**

1. **Filter Orders for February 2020**:
   - Use a `WHERE` clause with the condition `order_date BETWEEN '2020-02-01' AND '2020-02-29'` to select orders in February 2020.

2. **Calculate Total Units Ordered**:
   - Use `SUM(unit)` to calculate the total number of units ordered for each product in February 2020.
   - Group by `product_id`.

3. **Filter for Products with Units â‰¥ 100**:
   - Use the `HAVING` clause to filter products with a sum of units ordered greater than or equal to 100.

4. **Join with `Products` Table**:
   - Join the filtered results with the `Products` table on `product_id` to get the product names.

5. **Select and Return Results**:
   - Select `product_name` and total `unit` from the joined result.

### **SQL Query**

```sql
WITH ProductOrders AS (
    SELECT 
        product_id,
        SUM(unit) AS total_units
    FROM 
        Orders
    WHERE 
        order_date BETWEEN '2020-02-01' AND '2020-02-29'
    GROUP BY 
        product_id
    HAVING 
        SUM(unit) >= 100
)
SELECT 
    p.product_name,
    po.total_units AS unit
FROM 
    ProductOrders po
JOIN 
    Products p
ON 
    po.product_id = p.product_id;
```

### **Explanation of the Query**

1. **`WITH ProductOrders`**:
   - This Common Table Expression (CTE) calculates the total units ordered in February 2020 for each product, filtering for products with at least 100 units.

2. **`JOIN Products`**:
   - Combines the product IDs from the filtered orders with the `Products` table to retrieve the product names.

3. **`SELECT product_name, total_units`**:
   - Outputs the product name and total units for the filtered products.
