### 20. Monthly Transactions I

This SQL problem involves analyzing transactions to calculate several metrics for each month and country. The required metrics include the number of transactions, total amount, and the count and total amount of approved transactions.

---

### Problem Requirements

1. **Tables**:
   - **Transactions** table:
     - Contains information about incoming transactions.
     - Columns:
       - `id`: Unique identifier for each transaction.
       - `country`: Country where the transaction occurred.
       - `state`: Status of the transaction (`"approved"` or `"declined"`).
       - `amount`: Amount of the transaction.
       - `trans_date`: Date of the transaction.

2. **Metrics to Calculate**:
   - `month`: The year and month of the transaction (`YYYY-MM` format).
   - `country`: The country of the transaction.
   - `trans_count`: Total number of transactions.
   - `approved_count`: Number of approved transactions.
   - `trans_total_amount`: Total amount of all transactions.
   - `approved_total_amount`: Total amount of approved transactions.

3. **Return Requirements**:
   - Return one row for each combination of month and country.
   - Return the results in **any order**.

### Schema

#### Table: `Transactions`

| Column Name   | Type    | Description                                      |
|---------------|---------|--------------------------------------------------|
| `id`          | int     | Unique identifier for each transaction.          |
| `country`     | varchar | Country where the transaction occurred.          |
| `state`       | enum    | Transaction status (`"approved"` or `"declined"`).|
| `amount`      | int     | Amount of the transaction.                       |
| `trans_date`  | date    | Date of the transaction.                         |

### Example

#### Input

**Transactions** table:

| id   | country | state    | amount | trans_date |
|------|---------|----------|--------|------------|
| 121  | US      | approved | 1000   | 2018-12-18 |
| 122  | US      | declined | 2000   | 2018-12-19 |
| 123  | US      | approved | 2000   | 2019-01-01 |
| 124  | DE      | approved | 2000   | 2019-01-07 |

#### Output

| month    | country | trans_count | approved_count | trans_total_amount | approved_total_amount |
|----------|---------|-------------|----------------|--------------------|-----------------------|
| 2018-12  | US      | 2           | 1              | 3000               | 1000                  |
| 2019-01  | US      | 1           | 1              | 2000               | 2000                  |
| 2019-01  | DE      | 1           | 1              | 2000               | 2000                  |

### Solution

#### SQL Query

```sql
SELECT 
    DATE_FORMAT(trans_date, '%Y-%m') AS `month`,
    country,
    COUNT(state) AS trans_count,
    SUM(IF(state = 'approved', 1, 0)) AS approved_count,
    SUM(amount) AS trans_total_amount,
    SUM(IF(state = 'approved', amount, 0)) AS approved_total_amount
FROM 
    Transactions
GROUP BY 
    `month`, country;
```

---

### Explanation of the Query

1. **Extract Month**:
   - Use `DATE_FORMAT(trans_date, '%Y-%m')` to extract the year and month from the `trans_date`.

2. **Count Transactions**:
   - Use `COUNT(state)` to count the total number of transactions for each month and country.

3. **Count Approved Transactions**:
   - Use `SUM(IF(state = 'approved', 1, 0))` to count only the approved transactions.

4. **Calculate Total Amounts**:
   - Use `SUM(amount)` to calculate the total transaction amount.
   - Use `SUM(IF(state = 'approved', amount, 0))` to calculate the total amount of approved transactions.

5. **Group By**:
   - Group the results by `month` and `country` to get metrics for each combination.
