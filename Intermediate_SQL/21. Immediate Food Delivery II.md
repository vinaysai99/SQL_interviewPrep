### 21. Immediate Food Delivery II

This SQL problem involves calculating the percentage of immediate first orders for all customers, where the first order is determined by the earliest `order_date` for each customer. Immediate orders are defined as those where the `order_date` matches the `customer_pref_delivery_date`.

---

### Problem Requirements

1. **Tables**:
   - **Delivery** table:
     - Contains information about food deliveries.
     - Columns:
       - `delivery_id`: Unique identifier for each delivery.
       - `customer_id`: Identifier for the customer who placed the order.
       - `order_date`: Date the order was placed.
       - `customer_pref_delivery_date`: Preferred delivery date specified by the customer.

2. **Metrics to Calculate**:
   - `immediate_percentage`: Percentage of customers whose first order is immediate, rounded to 2 decimal places.

3. **Definitions**:
   - **First Order**: The order with the earliest `order_date` for each customer.
   - **Immediate Order**: An order where `order_date = customer_pref_delivery_date`.

4. **Return Requirements**:
   - A single column named `immediate_percentage` representing the calculated percentage.

### Example

#### Input

**Delivery** table:

| delivery_id | customer_id | order_date | customer_pref_delivery_date |
|-------------|-------------|------------|-----------------------------|
| 1           | 1           | 2019-08-01 | 2019-08-02                  |
| 2           | 2           | 2019-08-02 | 2019-08-02                  |
| 3           | 1           | 2019-08-11 | 2019-08-12                  |
| 4           | 3           | 2019-08-24 | 2019-08-24                  |
| 5           | 3           | 2019-08-21 | 2019-08-22                  |
| 6           | 2           | 2019-08-11 | 2019-08-13                  |
| 7           | 4           | 2019-08-09 | 2019-08-09                  |

#### Output

| immediate_percentage |
|-----------------------|
| 50.00                |

### Solution

#### SQL Query

```sql
SELECT 
    ROUND(AVG(order_date = customer_pref_delivery_date) * 100, 2) AS immediate_percentage
FROM 
    Delivery
WHERE 
    (customer_id, order_date) IN (
        SELECT 
            customer_id, MIN(order_date)
        FROM 
            Delivery
        GROUP BY 
            customer_id
    );
```

---

### Explanation of the Query

1. **Subquery**:
   - The subquery identifies the first order (`MIN(order_date)`) for each `customer_id`.
   - Groups the data by `customer_id` to ensure only one row (the earliest order) per customer.

   ```sql
   SELECT 
       customer_id, MIN(order_date)
   FROM 
       Delivery
   GROUP BY 
       customer_id
   ```

2. **Filtering First Orders**:
   - The main query filters the `Delivery` table to only include rows that correspond to the first order for each `customer_id` using the subquery.

   ```sql
   WHERE 
       (customer_id, order_date) IN (
           SELECT 
               customer_id, MIN(order_date)
           FROM 
               Delivery
           GROUP BY 
               customer_id
       )
   ```

3. **Calculate Immediate Percentage**:
   - For the filtered rows, compare `order_date` and `customer_pref_delivery_date` using `order_date = customer_pref_delivery_date`. This evaluates to `1` (true) for immediate orders and `0` (false) otherwise.
   - Use `AVG` to calculate the fraction of immediate first orders and multiply by 100 to get the percentage.
   - Round the result to 2 decimal places using `ROUND`.

   ```sql
   SELECT 
       ROUND(AVG(order_date = customer_pref_delivery_date) * 100, 2) AS immediate_percentage
   FROM 
       Delivery
   ```
