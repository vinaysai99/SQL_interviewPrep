### 22. Game Play Analysis IV

This SQL problem involves calculating the fraction of players who logged in again the day after their first login. The result should be rounded to 2 decimal places.

---

### Problem Requirements

1. **Tables**:
   - **Activity** table:
     - Contains player activity data.
     - Columns:
       - `player_id`: Identifier for the player.
       - `device_id`: Identifier for the device used.
       - `event_date`: Date of login activity.
       - `games_played`: Number of games played during the session.
     - `(player_id, event_date)` is the primary key.

2. **Metrics to Calculate**:
   - **Fraction**:
     - Count the number of players who logged in for two consecutive days starting from their first login date.
     - Divide that count by the total number of distinct players.

3. **Return Requirements**:
   - A single column named `fraction` with the calculated value rounded to 2 decimal places.

### Example

#### Input

**Activity** table:

| player_id | device_id | event_date | games_played |
|-----------|-----------|------------|--------------|
| 1         | 2         | 2016-03-01 | 5            |
| 1         | 2         | 2016-03-02 | 6            |
| 2         | 3         | 2017-06-25 | 1            |
| 3         | 1         | 2016-03-02 | 0            |
| 3         | 4         | 2018-07-03 | 5            |

#### Output

| fraction |
|----------|
| 0.33     |

#### Explanation

- Player `1`: Logged in on `2016-03-01` and again on `2016-03-02` (two consecutive days starting from their first login).
- Player `2`: Logged in on `2017-06-25` only once.
- Player `3`: Logged in on `2016-03-02` and `2018-07-03`, but not on the day after their first login.

The fraction is \( \frac{1}{3} = 0.33 \).

### Solution

#### SQL Query

```sql
SELECT 
    ROUND(COUNT(DISTINCT a1.player_id) / (SELECT COUNT(DISTINCT player_id) FROM Activity), 2) AS fraction
FROM 
    Activity a1
LEFT JOIN 
    Activity a2
ON 
    a1.player_id = a2.player_id
WHERE 
    DATEDIFF(a2.event_date, a1.event_date) = 1
    AND (a1.player_id, a1.event_date) IN (
        SELECT player_id, MIN(event_date)
        FROM Activity
        GROUP BY player_id
    );
```

---

### Explanation of the Query

1. **Identify the First Login**:
   - Use a subquery to determine the first login date (`MIN(event_date)`) for each `player_id`.

   ```sql
   SELECT player_id, MIN(event_date)
   FROM Activity
   GROUP BY player_id
   ```

2. **Find Players Logging in Consecutively**:
   - Join the `Activity` table (`a1`) with itself (`a2`) on `player_id`.
   - Filter rows where the difference between `event_date` in `a2` and `event_date` in `a1` is exactly 1 day (`DATEDIFF(a2.event_date, a1.event_date) = 1`).
   - Ensure that `a1` corresponds to the first login using the `IN` clause.

   ```sql
   LEFT JOIN Activity a2
   ON a1.player_id = a2.player_id
   WHERE DATEDIFF(a2.event_date, a1.event_date) = 1
   ```

3. **Calculate the Fraction**:
   - Count distinct `player_id` values meeting the criteria (players who logged in again the day after their first login).
   - Divide by the total number of distinct `player_id` values in the table.

   ```sql
   ROUND(COUNT(DISTINCT a1.player_id) / (SELECT COUNT(DISTINCT player_id) FROM Activity), 2)
   ```

4. **Round the Result**:
   - Use `ROUND` to round the fraction to 2 decimal places.
