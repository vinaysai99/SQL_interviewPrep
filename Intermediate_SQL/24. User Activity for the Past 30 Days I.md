### 24. User Activity for the Past 30 Days I

This problem involves calculating the number of active users for each day in a given 30-day period based on their activities.

---

### Problem Requirements

1. **Input Table**:
   - **Activity** table:
     - `user_id`: The user who performed an activity.
     - `session_id`: The session in which the activity was performed.
     - `activity_date`: The date of the activity.
     - `activity_type`: The type of activity (`open_session`, `end_session`, `scroll_down`, `send_message`).

2. **Output**:
   - Each day (`day`) and the count of unique active users (`active_users`) for that day.
   - Only include days where at least one user was active.

3. **Conditions**:
   - The date range is 30 days ending on `2019-07-27` (i.e., `2019-06-28` to `2019-07-27` inclusive).

### Example

#### Input

| user_id | session_id | activity_date | activity_type |
|---------|------------|---------------|---------------|
| 1       | 1          | 2019-07-20    | open_session  |
| 1       | 1          | 2019-07-20    | scroll_down   |
| 1       | 1          | 2019-07-20    | end_session   |
| 2       | 4          | 2019-07-20    | open_session  |
| 2       | 4          | 2019-07-21    | send_message  |
| 2       | 4          | 2019-07-21    | end_session   |
| 3       | 2          | 2019-07-21    | open_session  |
| 3       | 2          | 2019-07-21    | send_message  |
| 3       | 2          | 2019-07-21    | end_session   |
| 4       | 3          | 2019-06-25    | open_session  |
| 4       | 3          | 2019-06-25    | end_session   |

#### Output

| day        | active_users |
|------------|--------------|
| 2019-07-20 | 2            |
| 2019-07-21 | 2            |

### SQL Solution

```sql
SELECT 
    activity_date AS day,
    COUNT(DISTINCT user_id) AS active_users
FROM 
    activity
WHERE 
    activity_date BETWEEN '2019-06-28' AND '2019-07-27'
GROUP BY 
    activity_date;
```

---

### Explanation

1. **Filter the Date Range**:
   - Use the `WHERE` clause to limit `activity_date` to the 30-day range (`2019-06-28` to `2019-07-27`).

2. **Count Unique Users**:
   - Use `COUNT(DISTINCT user_id)` to calculate the number of unique users active on each day.

3. **Group by Day**:
   - Group by `activity_date` to get the count for each day.

4. **Only Include Days with Activities**:
   - Days with no activities are naturally excluded because `GROUP BY` only includes existing data.

---

### Key Points

- **`DISTINCT user_id`**: Ensures each user is counted only once per day.
- **Date Range**: Explicitly limits the analysis to the specified 30-day period.
- **`GROUP BY activity_date`**: Groups the data by day to calculate results for each specific date.
