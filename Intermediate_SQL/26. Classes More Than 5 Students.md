**Courses Table**:

| student | class    |
|---------|----------|
| A       | Math     |
| B       | English  |
| C       | Math     |
| D       | Biology  |
| E       | Math     |
| F       | Computer |
| G       | Math     |
| H       | Math     |
| I       | Math     |

#### Output

| class   |
|---------|
| Math    |

**Explanation**:
- **Math**: Has 6 students → Included.
- **English**: Has 1 student → Excluded.
- **Biology**: Has 1 student → Excluded.
- **Computer**: Has 1 student → Excluded.

### SQL Solution

```sql
SELECT class
FROM Courses
GROUP BY class
HAVING COUNT(student) >= 5;
```

---

### Explanation

1. **GROUP BY Clause**:
   - Groups the rows in the `Courses` table by `class`.
   - This ensures that the `COUNT(student)` calculation is done for each unique class.

2. **COUNT(student)**:
   - Counts the number of students enrolled in each class.

3. **HAVING Clause**:
   - Filters the grouped classes to only include those with `COUNT(student) >= 5`.

4. **Result Columns**:
   - Only the `class` column is included in the result.

5. **Result Order**:
   - Since the result can be in any order, no `ORDER BY` clause is required.

---

### Key Points

- **Primary Key**:
  - The combination of `(student, class)` ensures that there are no duplicate rows for a student in a class, so the `COUNT` reflects the actual number of students per class.
  
- **Filtering with HAVING**:
  - The `HAVING` clause operates on grouped data, making it suitable for filtering based on aggregate functions like `COUNT`.
