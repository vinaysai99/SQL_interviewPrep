### 27. Find Followers Count

This problem involves calculating the number of followers for each user in a social media app.

---

### Problem Requirements

1. **Input**:
   - **Followers Table**:
     - `user_id`: ID of the user being followed.
     - `follower_id`: ID of the user who follows `user_id`.

2. **Output**:
   - Each `user_id` along with the count of their followers (`followers_count`).

3. **Conditions**:
   - The result should be ordered by `user_id` in ascending order.

### Example

#### Input

**Followers Table**:

| user_id | follower_id |
|---------|-------------|
| 0       | 1           |
| 1       | 0           |
| 2       | 0           |
| 2       | 1           |

#### Output

| user_id | followers_count |
|---------|-----------------|
| 0       | 1               |
| 1       | 1               |
| 2       | 2               |

**Explanation**:
- **User 0**: Followed by user 1 → 1 follower.
- **User 1**: Followed by user 0 → 1 follower.
- **User 2**: Followed by users 0 and 1 → 2 followers.

### SQL Solution

```sql
SELECT user_id,
       COUNT(follower_id) AS followers_count
FROM Followers
GROUP BY user_id
ORDER BY user_id;
```

---

### Explanation

1. **COUNT(follower_id)**:
   - Counts the number of followers for each `user_id`.

2. **GROUP BY Clause**:
   - Groups the rows by `user_id` to calculate the follower count for each user.

3. **ORDER BY Clause**:
   - Ensures that the result is ordered by `user_id` in ascending order.

4. **Result Columns**:
   - Includes `user_id` and the calculated `followers_count`.

---

### Key Points

- **Primary Key**:
  - `(user_id, follower_id)` ensures that no duplicate follower records exist.

- **Grouping**:
  - The `GROUP BY` clause is necessary to count the followers for each unique `user_id`.
