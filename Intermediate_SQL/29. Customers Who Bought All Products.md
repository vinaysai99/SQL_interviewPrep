### 29. Customers Who Bought All Products

This problem requires identifying customers who have purchased every product listed in the `Product` table.

---

### Problem Requirements

1. **Input**:
   - **Customer Table**:
     - `customer_id`: The ID of the customer.
     - `product_key`: The key for the product the customer bought.
   - **Product Table**:
     - `product_key`: The unique key for each product.

2. **Output**:
   - A single column containing the `customer_id` of customers who purchased all products in the `Product` table.

### Example

#### Example 1:

**Input**:

**Customer Table**:

| customer_id | product_key |
|-------------|-------------|
| 1           | 5           |
| 2           | 6           |
| 3           | 5           |
| 3           | 6           |
| 1           | 6           |

**Product Table**:

| product_key |
|-------------|
| 5           |
| 6           |

**Output**:

| customer_id |
|-------------|
| 1           |
| 3           |

**Explanation**:
- Products in the `Product` table: `5, 6`.
- Customer `1` purchased `5, 6`.
- Customer `3` purchased `5, 6`.
- Customer `2` did not purchase all products.

### SQL Solution

```sql
SELECT customer_id
FROM Customer
GROUP BY customer_id
HAVING COUNT(DISTINCT product_key) = (SELECT COUNT(product_key) FROM Product);
```

---

### Explanation

1. **Subquery**:
   - `(SELECT COUNT(product_key) FROM Product)`:
     - Counts the total number of distinct products in the `Product` table.
     - This represents the number of products that a customer must buy.

2. **Group By Customer**:
   - `GROUP BY customer_id`:
     - Groups the `Customer` table by `customer_id` to evaluate each customer's purchases.

3. **HAVING Clause**:
   - `HAVING COUNT(DISTINCT product_key) = (SELECT COUNT(product_key) FROM Product)`:
     - Checks if the number of distinct products a customer bought matches the total number of products.

4. **Output**:
   - The query returns `customer_id` for those who meet the condition.

---

### Key Points

- **Distinct Product Keys**:
  - Ensures each product is counted only once per customer.

- **Group and Filter**:
  - The `GROUP BY` and `HAVING` clauses filter customers who meet the condition.

- **Scalability**:
  - The solution works even if the `Product` table or `Customer` table expands.

### Example Query Execution

#### Input:

**Customer Table**:

| customer_id | product_key |
|-------------|-------------|
| 1           | 1           |
| 1           | 2           |
| 2           | 1           |
| 3           | 1           |
| 3           | 2           |

**Product Table**:

| product_key |
|-------------|
| 1           |
| 2           |

#### Steps:

1. **Count Total Products**:
   - `SELECT COUNT(product_key) FROM Product;`
   - Result: `2`.

2. **Group Customers**:
   - Query:
     ```sql
     SELECT customer_id, COUNT(DISTINCT product_key)
     FROM Customer
     GROUP BY customer_id;
     ```
   - Result:
     | customer_id | COUNT(DISTINCT product_key) |
     |-------------|-----------------------------|
     | 1           | 2                           |
     | 2           | 1                           |
     | 3           | 2                           |

3. **Filter by Product Count**:
   - Only customers with `COUNT(DISTINCT product_key) = 2`:
     | customer_id |
     |-------------|
     | 1           |
     | 3           |
