### 30. The Number of Employees Who Report to Each Employee

This problem involves identifying managers (employees who have at least one direct report), counting the number of employees reporting to them, and calculating the average age of those employees.

---

### Problem Requirements

1. **Input**:
   - **Employees Table**:
     - `employee_id`: Unique identifier for employees.
     - `name`: Name of the employee.
     - `reports_to`: ID of the manager the employee reports to (can be `NULL` for employees without a manager).
     - `age`: Age of the employee.

2. **Output**:
   - The `employee_id`, `name`, `reports_count` (number of direct reports), and `average_age` (average age of the direct reports, rounded to the nearest integer) for each manager.
   - Results should be ordered by `employee_id`.

### Example

#### Example 1:

**Input**:

| employee_id | name    | reports_to | age |
|-------------|---------|------------|-----|
| 9           | Hercy   | null       | 43  |
| 6           | Alice   | 9          | 41  |
| 4           | Bob     | 9          | 36  |
| 2           | Winston | null       | 37  |

**Output**:

| employee_id | name  | reports_count | average_age |
|-------------|-------|---------------|-------------|
| 9           | Hercy | 2             | 39          |

**Explanation**:
- `Hercy` has two direct reports: `Alice` (age 41) and `Bob` (age 36).
- Their average age is `(41 + 36) / 2 = 38.5`, rounded to 39.

#### Example 2:

**Input**:

| employee_id | name    | reports_to | age |
|-------------|---------|------------|-----|
| 1           | Michael | null       | 45  |
| 2           | Alice   | 1          | 38  |
| 3           | Bob     | 1          | 42  |
| 4           | Charlie | 2          | 34  |
| 5           | David   | 2          | 40  |
| 6           | Eve     | 3          | 37  |
| 7           | Frank   | null       | 50  |
| 8           | Grace   | null       | 48  |

**Output**:

| employee_id | name    | reports_count | average_age |
|-------------|---------|---------------|-------------|
| 1           | Michael | 2             | 40          |
| 2           | Alice   | 2             | 37          |
| 3           | Bob     | 1             | 37          |

**Explanation**:
- `Michael` has two direct reports (`Alice` and `Bob`), with an average age of `(38 + 42) / 2 = 40`.
- `Alice` has two direct reports (`Charlie` and `David`), with an average age of `(34 + 40) / 2 = 37`.
- `Bob` has one direct report (`Eve`), with an average age of `37`.

### SQL Solution

```sql
SELECT 
    e2.employee_id,
    e2.name,
    COUNT(e1.employee_id) AS reports_count,
    ROUND(AVG(e1.age), 0) AS average_age
FROM 
    employees e1
JOIN 
    employees e2
ON 
    e1.reports_to = e2.employee_id
GROUP BY 
    e2.employee_id, e2.name
ORDER BY 
    e2.employee_id;
```

---

### Explanation of the Query

1. **Join Employees Table with Itself**:
   - `JOIN employees e2 ON e1.reports_to = e2.employee_id`:
     - Matches employees (`e1`) with their managers (`e2`) by checking if `e1.reports_to` matches `e2.employee_id`.

2. **Group By Manager**:
   - `GROUP BY e2.employee_id, e2.name`:
     - Groups the data by manager to calculate statistics for each manager.

3. **Count and Average**:
   - `COUNT(e1.employee_id)`:
     - Counts the number of direct reports for each manager.
   - `AVG(e1.age)`:
     - Calculates the average age of the direct reports.
   - `ROUND(AVG(e1.age), 0)`:
     - Rounds the average age to the nearest integer.

4. **Order By**:
   - `ORDER BY e2.employee_id`:
     - Ensures the result is ordered by the `employee_id` of the managers.

---

### Key Points

- **Managers**:
  - Defined as employees who have at least one direct report.
  - Identified by matching `employee_id` with `reports_to`.

- **NULL Handling**:
  - Employees with `reports_to = NULL` do not report to anyone and are not included in the result.

- **Scalability**:
  - The query efficiently handles large datasets by using `JOIN` and `GROUP BY`.
