### 31. Primary Department for Each Employee

The goal is to identify the **primary department** for each employee based on the `primary_flag` column or default to their only department if they belong to just one.

---

### Problem Requirements

1. **Input**:
   - **Employee Table**:
     - `employee_id`: Unique identifier for employees.
     - `department_id`: ID of the department.
     - `primary_flag`: Indicates whether the department is the primary one for the employee (`'Y'` for primary, `'N'` otherwise).

2. **Output**:
   - The `employee_id` and their `primary department_id`.

3. **Rules**:
   - If an employee belongs to **one department**, that department is treated as their primary.
   - If an employee belongs to **multiple departments**, the one with the `primary_flag = 'Y'` is their primary.

### Example

#### Example 1:

**Input**:

| employee_id | department_id | primary_flag |
|-------------|---------------|--------------|
| 1           | 1             | N            |
| 2           | 1             | Y            |
| 2           | 2             | N            |
| 3           | 3             | N            |
| 4           | 2             | N            |
| 4           | 3             | Y            |
| 4           | 4             | N            |

**Output**:

| employee_id | department_id |
|-------------|---------------|
| 1           | 1             |
| 2           | 1             |
| 3           | 3             |
| 4           | 3             |

**Explanation**:
- Employee `1` belongs to only one department (ID `1`), so it is their primary.
- Employee `2` has a `primary_flag = 'Y'` for department ID `1`.
- Employee `3` belongs to only one department (ID `3`), so it is their primary.
- Employee `4` has a `primary_flag = 'Y'` for department ID `3`.

### SQL Solution

```sql
WITH multiple_dept AS (
    SELECT 
        employee_id,
        COUNT(department_id) AS depts
    FROM 
        employee
    GROUP BY 
        employee_id
)
SELECT 
    e.employee_id,
    e.department_id
FROM 
    employee e
JOIN 
    multiple_dept md
ON 
    e.employee_id = md.employee_id
WHERE 
    md.depts = 1 OR e.primary_flag = 'Y';
```

---

### Explanation of the Query

1. **Identify Employees with Multiple Departments**:
   - Use a **Common Table Expression (CTE)** to count the number of departments each employee belongs to:
     ```sql
     WITH multiple_dept AS (
         SELECT 
             employee_id,
             COUNT(department_id) AS depts
         FROM 
             employee
         GROUP BY 
             employee_id
     )
     ```

2. **Join CTE with Employee Table**:
   - Join the `multiple_dept` CTE back to the `employee` table using `employee_id`.

3. **Filter for Primary Departments**:
   - For employees with **only one department**, include their only `department_id`.
   - For employees with **multiple departments**, include the department with `primary_flag = 'Y'`:
     ```sql
     WHERE 
         md.depts = 1 OR e.primary_flag = 'Y';
     ```

4. **Return Required Columns**:
   - Select `employee_id` and their primary `department_id`.

### Key Points

- The solution handles two scenarios:
  - Employees with **one department**.
  - Employees with **multiple departments** and a designated primary.
- The use of a CTE simplifies identifying employees with multiple departments.
