### 33. Consecutive Numbers

The task is to find all numbers in the table that appear at least three times consecutively.

---

### Problem Requirements

1. **Input**:
   - **Logs Table**:
     - `id`: Autoincrementing primary key.
     - `num`: Value to analyze for consecutive occurrences.

2. **Output**:
   - A single column `ConsecutiveNums` listing all numbers that appear at least three times consecutively.

### Example

#### Input:

| id | num |
|----|-----|
| 1  | 1   |
| 2  | 1   |
| 3  | 1   |
| 4  | 2   |
| 5  | 1   |
| 6  | 2   |
| 7  | 2   |

#### Output:

| ConsecutiveNums |
|-----------------|
| 1               |

**Explanation**:
- The number `1` appears consecutively in rows with `id` values `(1, 2, 3)`.

---

### SQL Solution

```sql
SELECT DISTINCT l1.num AS ConsecutiveNums
FROM Logs l1
JOIN Logs l2 ON l1.id = l2.id - 1
JOIN Logs l3 ON l1.id = l3.id - 2
WHERE l1.num = l2.num
  AND l1.num = l3.num;
```

---

### Explanation of the Query

1. **Self-Join**:
   - The `Logs` table is joined with itself twice to compare consecutive rows:
     - `l1.id = l2.id - 1`: Ensures `l2` is the row immediately after `l1`.
     - `l1.id = l3.id - 2`: Ensures `l3` is two rows after `l1`.

2. **Condition**:
   - `l1.num = l2.num` and `l1.num = l3.num` ensure that the same number appears in all three consecutive rows.

3. **Distinct Values**:
   - Use `DISTINCT` to avoid duplicates in the result.

4. **Result**:
   - Only numbers that meet the conditions are included in the result.

### Example Walkthrough

Given the input table:

| id | num |
|----|-----|
| 1  | 1   |
| 2  | 1   |
| 3  | 1   |
| 4  | 2   |
| 5  | 1   |
| 6  | 2   |
| 7  | 2   |

- **Step 1**: Join rows:
  - `(1, 2, 3)` for `1`.
  - `(5, 6, 7)` for `2`.

- **Step 2**: Apply the condition:
  - Only `(1, 2, 3)` satisfies `num = 1` three times consecutively.

- **Step 3**: Return `1` as the result.

### Output Columns

- `ConsecutiveNums`: Numbers that appear three times consecutively.
