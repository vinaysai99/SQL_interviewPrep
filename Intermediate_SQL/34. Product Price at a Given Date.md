### 34. Product Price at a Given Date

The task is to determine the prices of all products on a specific date (`2019-08-16`). 

---

### Problem Requirements

1. **Input**:
   - **Products Table**:
     - `product_id`: ID of the product.
     - `new_price`: Updated price of the product at the given `change_date`.
     - `change_date`: Date on which the price of the product was updated.

2. **Output**:
   - A table with the `product_id` and its `price` on `2019-08-16`.

3. **Assumption**:
   - The default price of all products before any change is `10`.

### Example

#### Input:

| product_id | new_price | change_date |
|------------|-----------|-------------|
| 1          | 20        | 2019-08-14  |
| 2          | 50        | 2019-08-14  |
| 1          | 30        | 2019-08-15  |
| 1          | 35        | 2019-08-16  |
| 2          | 65        | 2019-08-17  |
| 3          | 20        | 2019-08-18  |

#### Output:

| product_id | price |
|------------|-------|
| 1          | 35    |
| 2          | 50    |
| 3          | 10    |

**Explanation**:
- For `product_id = 1`, the price on `2019-08-16` is `35` (latest change on or before the given date).
- For `product_id = 2`, the price on `2019-08-16` is `50` (latest change on or before the given date).
- For `product_id = 3`, there is no change before or on `2019-08-16`, so the default price `10` applies.

### SQL Solution

```sql
SELECT DISTINCT product_id,
                10 AS price
FROM   products
WHERE  product_id NOT IN (
           SELECT DISTINCT product_id
           FROM products
           WHERE change_date <= '2019-08-16'
       )
UNION
SELECT product_id,
       new_price AS price
FROM   products
WHERE  (product_id, change_date) IN (
           SELECT product_id,
                  MAX(change_date) AS date
           FROM   products
           WHERE  change_date <= '2019-08-16'
           GROUP  BY product_id
       );
```

### Explanation of the Query

1. **Find Products with No Price Changes Before the Date**:
   - Identify `product_id`s that have no price updates on or before `2019-08-16`.
   - Assign a default price of `10`.

2. **Find Latest Price Change Before or on the Date**:
   - For products with updates, find the latest price change on or before `2019-08-16`.
   - Use a subquery to find the maximum `change_date` for each product.

3. **Combine Results**:
   - Use `UNION` to combine both cases:
     - Products with no changes default to `10`.
     - Products with updates use their latest price.

### Example Walkthrough

Given the `Products` table:

| product_id | new_price | change_date |
|------------|-----------|-------------|
| 1          | 20        | 2019-08-14  |
| 2          | 50        | 2019-08-14  |
| 1          | 30        | 2019-08-15  |
| 1          | 35        | 2019-08-16  |
| 2          | 65        | 2019-08-17  |
| 3          | 20        | 2019-08-18  |

- **Step 1**: Identify products without updates (`product_id = 3` â†’ price = `10`).
- **Step 2**: Find the latest change for each product on or before `2019-08-16`:
  - `product_id = 1`: Latest price = `35`.
  - `product_id = 2`: Latest price = `50`.
