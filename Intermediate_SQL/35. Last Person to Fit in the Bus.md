### 34. Last Person to Fit in the Bus

The task is to find the name of the last person who can board a bus without exceeding its weight limit of 1000 kg.

---

### Problem Requirements

1. **Input**:
   - **Queue Table**:
     - `person_id`: Unique identifier for each person.
     - `person_name`: Name of the person.
     - `weight`: Weight of the person in kilograms.
     - `turn`: Order in which people board the bus (starting from 1).

2. **Output**:
   - A table containing the name of the last person who can board the bus without exceeding the weight limit.

3. **Constraints**:
   - People board one at a time, in order determined by `turn`.
   - If adding a person's weight exceeds the weight limit, they cannot board.

### Example

#### Input:

| person_id | person_name | weight | turn |
|-----------|-------------|--------|------|
| 5         | Alice       | 250    | 1    |
| 4         | Bob         | 175    | 5    |
| 3         | Alex        | 350    | 2    |
| 6         | John Cena   | 400    | 3    |
| 1         | Winston     | 500    | 6    |
| 2         | Marie       | 200    | 4    |

#### Output:

| person_name |
|-------------|
| John Cena   |

**Explanation**:
- Ordered by `turn`:
  - Alice boards first (250 kg, total = 250).
  - Alex boards next (350 kg, total = 600).
  - John Cena boards next (400 kg, total = 1000).
  - Marie would exceed the limit (1200 kg) and cannot board.
- The last person to successfully board is **John Cena**.

### SQL Solution

```sql
SELECT q1.person_name
FROM   queue q1
       JOIN queue q2
         ON q2.turn <= q1.turn
GROUP  BY q1.turn, q1.person_name
HAVING SUM(q2.weight) <= 1000
ORDER  BY SUM(q2.weight) DESC
LIMIT  1;
```

---

### Explanation of the Query

1. **Join to Calculate Cumulative Weight**:
   - Join the table `queue` on itself to calculate cumulative weights up to a given `turn`.
   - For every person `q1`, include all persons `q2` whose `turn` is less than or equal to `q1.turn`.

2. **Filter Cumulative Weight**:
   - Use `HAVING` to ensure the cumulative weight up to each person does not exceed the weight limit (`1000`).

3. **Find the Last Person**:
   - Sort by the cumulative weight (`SUM(q2.weight)`) in descending order.
   - Use `LIMIT 1` to get the last person who fits within the weight limit.

4. **Group and Return Results**:
   - Group by `q1.turn` and `q1.person_name` to ensure only distinct entries are considered.

### Example Walkthrough

#### Intermediate Steps:

| Turn | ID | Name      | Weight | Total Weight |
|------|----|-----------|--------|--------------|
| 1    | 5  | Alice     | 250    | 250          |
| 2    | 3  | Alex      | 350    | 600          |
| 3    | 6  | John Cena | 400    | 1000         | (last person to board)
| 4    | 2  | Marie     | 200    | 1200         | (cannot board)
| 5    | 4  | Bob       | 175    | ___          |
| 6    | 1  | Winston   | 500    | ___          |

The query ensures that only valid entries up to the weight limit are considered.
