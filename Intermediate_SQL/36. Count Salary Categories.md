### 36. Count Salary Categories

The goal is to calculate the number of bank accounts in each salary category. If a category has no accounts, return a count of `0`.

---

### Problem Requirements

1. **Input**:
   - **Accounts Table**:
     - `account_id`: Unique identifier for each account.
     - `income`: Monthly income of the account.

2. **Output**:
   - A table with two columns:
     - `category`: Salary category ("Low Salary", "Average Salary", or "High Salary").
     - `accounts_count`: Number of accounts in each category.

3. **Categories**:
   - **Low Salary**: `income < 20000`.
   - **Average Salary**: `20000 ≤ income ≤ 50000`.
   - **High Salary**: `income > 50000`.

### Example

#### Input:

| account_id | income |
|------------|--------|
| 3          | 108939 |
| 2          | 12747  |
| 8          | 87709  |
| 6          | 91796  |

#### Output:

| category       | accounts_count |
|----------------|----------------|
| Low Salary     | 1              |
| Average Salary | 0              |
| High Salary    | 3              |

**Explanation**:
- **Low Salary**: Account `2` falls in this category.
- **Average Salary**: No accounts in this range.
- **High Salary**: Accounts `3`, `6`, and `8`.

### SQL Solution

```sql
WITH category_cte AS (
    SELECT 
        CASE
            WHEN income < 20000 THEN 'Low Salary'
            WHEN income > 50000 THEN 'High Salary'
            ELSE 'Average Salary'
        END AS category
    FROM accounts
),
all_categories AS (
    SELECT 'Low Salary' AS category
    UNION ALL
    SELECT 'Average Salary'
    UNION ALL
    SELECT 'High Salary'
)
SELECT 
    ac.category,
    COALESCE(cc.accounts_count, 0) AS accounts_count
FROM 
    all_categories ac
LEFT JOIN (
    SELECT 
        category,
        COUNT(category) AS accounts_count
    FROM 
        category_cte
    GROUP BY 
        category
) cc
ON ac.category = cc.category;
```

### Explanation of the Query

1. **Categorize Accounts**:
   - Use a `CASE` statement in the `category_cte` common table expression (CTE) to classify each account into one of the three categories based on its `income`.

2. **Include All Categories**:
   - Create a CTE `all_categories` that contains all three categories (`Low Salary`, `Average Salary`, `High Salary`) to ensure every category is included in the final result, even if it has zero accounts.

3. **Count Accounts by Category**:
   - In the second part of the query, count the number of accounts in each category using the `COUNT()` function and `GROUP BY`.

4. **Combine Results**:
   - Perform a `LEFT JOIN` between `all_categories` and the counted results (`cc`).
   - Use `COALESCE()` to handle cases where a category has no accounts (resulting in `NULL`) and replace it with `0`.

### Output for the Example:

| category       | accounts_count |
|----------------|----------------|
| Low Salary     | 1              |
| Average Salary | 0              |
| High Salary    | 3              |
