### 37. Employees Whose Manager Left the Company

The task is to find the employees with a salary strictly less than `$30000` whose manager has left the company. When a manager leaves, their `employee_id` is no longer present in the table, but the `manager_id` for the affected employees remains unchanged.

---

### Problem Details

1. **Input**:
   - **Table: `Employees`**
     - Columns:
       - `employee_id`: Unique ID of the employee.
       - `name`: Name of the employee.
       - `manager_id`: ID of the employee's manager. Null if the employee has no manager.
       - `salary`: Salary of the employee.

2. **Output**:
   - The `employee_id` values of employees meeting the conditions:
     - Salary is less than `$30000`.
     - Their `manager_id` does not correspond to any `employee_id` in the table (i.e., their manager left the company).
   - Results ordered by `employee_id`.

3. **Constraints**:
   - Each `employee_id` is unique.
   - The `manager_id` is a reference to an `employee_id`, but not all `manager_id` values are guaranteed to exist in the table.

---

### SQL Solution

```sql
SELECT employee_id
FROM   employees
WHERE  salary < 30000
       AND manager_id NOT IN (SELECT employee_id
                              FROM   employees)
ORDER  BY employee_id;
```

---

### Explanation

1. **Filter Salary**:
   - `salary < 30000`: Only consider employees earning less than `$30000`.

2. **Check Manager Status**:
   - `manager_id NOT IN (SELECT employee_id FROM employees)`: Identifies employees whose `manager_id` does not match any `employee_id` in the table, indicating that their manager has left.

3. **Order Results**:
   - `ORDER BY employee_id`: Ensures the result is sorted by `employee_id`.

### Example Input and Output

#### Example 1:

**Input**:

| employee_id | name      | manager_id | salary |
|-------------|-----------|------------|--------|
| 3           | Mila      | 9          | 60301  |
| 12          | Antonella | null       | 31000  |
| 13          | Emery     | null       | 67084  |
| 1           | Kalel     | 11         | 21241  |
| 9           | Mikaela   | null       | 50937  |
| 11          | Joziah    | 6          | 28485  |

**Output**:

| employee_id |
|-------------|
| 11          |

**Explanation**:
- Employees with `salary < 30000`: `1` (Kalel) and `11` (Joziah).
- Kalel's manager (`manager_id = 11`) is still in the company, so Kalel is excluded.
- Joziah's manager (`manager_id = 6`) has left the company because there is no row for `employee_id = 6`.
- Result: Employee `11`.
