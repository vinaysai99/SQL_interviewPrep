### 38. Exchange Seats

The task is to swap the `id` of every two consecutive students in the `Seat` table. If the number of students is odd, the last student's `id` remains unchanged.

---

### Problem Details

1. **Input**:
   - **Table: `Seat`**
     - Columns:
       - `id`: Unique and sequential ID starting from 1.
       - `student`: Name of the student.

2. **Output**:
   - A result table where:
     - Consecutive `id`s are swapped.
     - The last student's `id` is unchanged if the total number of students is odd.
   - The result is sorted by `id` in ascending order.

3. **Constraints**:
   - IDs are sequential and increment continuously starting from 1.

### SQL Solution

#### Solution 1: Using `CASE`

```sql
SELECT 
    CASE
        WHEN MOD(id, 2) = 1 AND id < (SELECT MAX(id) FROM Seat) THEN id + 1
        WHEN MOD(id, 2) = 0 THEN id - 1
        ELSE id
    END AS id,
    student
FROM Seat
ORDER BY id;
```

---

### Explanation

1. **Swap Logic**:
   - If `id` is odd (`MOD(id, 2) = 1`) and not the last student, swap with the next `id` (`id + 1`).
   - If `id` is even, swap with the previous `id` (`id - 1`).
   - If it's the last `id` (and odd), it remains unchanged.

2. **Ordering**:
   - The result table is ordered by the swapped `id` values to ensure ascending order.

### Example Input and Output

#### Example 1:

**Input**:

| id | student  |
|----|----------|
| 1  | Abbot    |
| 2  | Doris    |
| 3  | Emerson  |
| 4  | Green    |
| 5  | Jeames   |

**Output**:

| id | student  |
|----|----------|
| 1  | Doris    |
| 2  | Abbot    |
| 3  | Green    |
| 4  | Emerson  |
| 5  | Jeames   |

**Explanation**:
- Abbot (`id = 1`) swaps with Doris (`id = 2`).
- Emerson (`id = 3`) swaps with Green (`id = 4`).
- Jeames (`id = 5`) remains unchanged because it's the last `id` and odd.

---

#### Solution 2: Using Window Functions

```sql
SELECT 
    ROW_NUMBER() OVER (ORDER BY IF(MOD(id, 2) = 0, id - 1, id + 1)) AS id,
    student
FROM Seat;
```

---

### Explanation of Alternative Solution

1. **Window Function Logic**:
   - The `IF` statement adjusts the `id` values for even and odd cases:
     - Even: `id - 1`.
     - Odd: `id + 1`.
   - Uses `ROW_NUMBER()` to generate the new `id` sequence based on the adjusted order.

2. **Ordering**:
   - Orders the result by the swapped `id` logic, ensuring ascending order of `id`.
