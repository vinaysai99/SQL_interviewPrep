### **39. Movie Rating**

The task involves querying information about movie ratings to determine:
1. The user who has rated the most movies.
2. The movie with the highest average rating in February 2020.

---

### **Problem Details**

1. **Input Tables**:
   - **`Movies`**: Contains information about movies (`movie_id`, `title`).
   - **`Users`**: Contains information about users (`user_id`, `name`).
   - **`MovieRating`**: Contains information about user ratings for movies (`movie_id`, `user_id`, `rating`, `created_at`).

2. **Output**:
   - **`results`**: 
     - Row 1: User with the most ratings (break ties by lexicographical order of `name`).
     - Row 2: Movie with the highest average rating in February 2020 (break ties by lexicographical order of `title`).

---

### **Solution**

Hereâ€™s the SQL query that solves the problem:

```sql
(SELECT 
     name AS results
 FROM 
     MovieRating m
 INNER JOIN 
     Users u
 ON 
     m.user_id = u.user_id
 GROUP BY 
     m.user_id
 ORDER BY 
     COUNT(rating) DESC, 
     name ASC
 LIMIT 1)
UNION ALL
(SELECT 
     title AS results
 FROM 
     MovieRating m
 INNER JOIN 
     Movies ms
 ON 
     m.movie_id = ms.movie_id
 WHERE 
     created_at BETWEEN '2020-02-01' AND '2020-02-28'
 GROUP BY 
     m.movie_id
 ORDER BY 
     AVG(rating) DESC, 
     title ASC
 LIMIT 1);
```

### **Explanation**

#### **Part 1: User with Most Ratings**
1. **Join Tables**:
   - Join `MovieRating` with `Users` on `user_id`.
2. **Aggregate and Sort**:
   - Group by `user_id` and count the number of ratings.
   - Sort by:
     - Highest number of ratings (`COUNT(rating)` in descending order).
     - Lexicographically smallest `name` (in ascending order).
3. **Return Result**:
   - Use `LIMIT 1` to get the top user.

#### **Part 2: Movie with Highest Average Rating in February 2020**
1. **Filter by Date**:
   - Include only ratings where `created_at` falls between `2020-02-01` and `2020-02-28`.
2. **Join Tables**:
   - Join `MovieRating` with `Movies` on `movie_id`.
3. **Aggregate and Sort**:
   - Group by `movie_id` and calculate the average rating (`AVG(rating)`).
   - Sort by:
     - Highest average rating (descending).
     - Lexicographically smallest `title` (ascending).
4. **Return Result**:
   - Use `LIMIT 1` to get the top movie.

#### **Combine Results**
- Use `UNION ALL` to combine the two results into a single output.
