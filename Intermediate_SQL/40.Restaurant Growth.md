### **40. Restaurant Growth**

The task is to calculate a 7-day moving average (`current day + 6 days before`) of customer spending and return the total amount and average for each day starting from the 7th day.

---

### **Problem Details**

1. **Input Table**:
   - **`Customer`**:
     - `customer_id`: Unique identifier for a customer.
     - `name`: Name of the customer.
     - `visited_on`: Date of the visit.
     - `amount`: Total amount paid by the customer during the visit.

2. **Output**:
   - For each day (starting from the 7th day), calculate:
     - The total `amount` paid in the last 7 days (including the current day).
     - The 7-day moving average, rounded to 2 decimal places.

3. **Constraints**:
   - The `Customer` table will have at least one entry for every day.

### **Solution**

Here's the SQL query to solve the problem:

```sql
WITH CTE AS (
    SELECT 
        visited_on, 
        SUM(amount) AS days_sum 
    FROM 
        Customer
    GROUP BY 
        visited_on
    ORDER BY 
        visited_on ASC
)
SELECT 
    visited_on,
    SUM(days_sum) OVER (ORDER BY visited_on ROWS BETWEEN 6 PRECEDING AND CURRENT ROW) AS amount,
    ROUND(AVG(days_sum) OVER (ORDER BY visited_on ROWS BETWEEN 6 PRECEDING AND CURRENT ROW), 2) AS average_amount
FROM 
    CTE
LIMIT 999 OFFSET 6;
```

---

### **Explanation**

#### **Step 1: Aggregate Daily Amounts**
- Use a Common Table Expression (CTE) to aggregate the total `amount` for each `visited_on` date:
  ```sql
  WITH CTE AS (
      SELECT 
          visited_on, 
          SUM(amount) AS days_sum 
      FROM 
          Customer
      GROUP BY 
          visited_on
      ORDER BY 
          visited_on ASC
  )
  ```

#### **Step 2: Calculate 7-Day Moving Total and Average**
- Use window functions to calculate:
  - The 7-day moving total: `SUM(days_sum) OVER (...)`.
  - The 7-day moving average: `AVG(days_sum) OVER (...)`.
- Define the window as `ROWS BETWEEN 6 PRECEDING AND CURRENT ROW` to include the current day and the 6 previous days:
  ```sql
  SELECT 
      visited_on,
      SUM(days_sum) OVER (ORDER BY visited_on ROWS BETWEEN 6 PRECEDING AND CURRENT ROW) AS amount,
      ROUND(AVG(days_sum) OVER (ORDER BY visited_on ROWS BETWEEN 6 PRECEDING AND CURRENT ROW), 2) AS average_amount
  FROM 
      CTE
  ```

#### **Step 3: Skip Initial Days**
- Start from the 7th day by adding an `OFFSET` of 6:
  ```sql
  LIMIT 999 OFFSET 6;
  ```

### **Output Example**

#### **Input**

**`Customer` Table**:

| customer_id | name    | visited_on | amount |
|-------------|---------|------------|--------|
| 1           | Jhon    | 2019-01-01 | 100    |
| 2           | Daniel  | 2019-01-02 | 110    |
| 3           | Jade    | 2019-01-03 | 120    |
| 4           | Khaled  | 2019-01-04 | 130    |
| 5           | Winston | 2019-01-05 | 110    |
| 6           | Elvis   | 2019-01-06 | 140    |
| 7           | Anna    | 2019-01-07 | 150    |
| 8           | Maria   | 2019-01-08 | 80     |
| 9           | Jaze    | 2019-01-09 | 110    |
| 10          | Jhon    | 2019-01-10 | 130    |
| 11          | Jade    | 2019-01-10 | 150    |

---

#### **Output**

| visited_on | amount | average_amount |
|------------|--------|----------------|
| 2019-01-07 | 860    | 122.86         |
| 2019-01-08 | 840    | 120.00         |
| 2019-01-09 | 840    | 120.00         |
| 2019-01-10 | 1000   | 142.86         |

### **Key Points**
- **Window Functions**:
  - `SUM()` and `AVG()` are used to calculate the moving total and average.
- **Offset**:
  - Exclude the first 6 days because they don't have a full 7-day window. 
- **Rounding**:
  - `ROUND()` ensures the average is displayed with 2 decimal places.
