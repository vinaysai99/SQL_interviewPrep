### **41. Friend Requests II: Who Has the Most Friends**

The task is to identify the user who has the most friends and return their `id` and the total number of friends (`num`).

---

### **Problem Details**

1. **Input Table**:
   - **`RequestAccepted`**:
     - `requester_id`: The ID of the user who sent the friend request.
     - `accepter_id`: The ID of the user who accepted the friend request.
     - `accept_date`: The date when the request was accepted.

2. **Output**:
   - The `id` of the person with the most friends.
   - The total number of friends (`num`) that person has.

3. **Constraints**:
   - Test cases guarantee that only one person will have the most friends.

### **Solution**

We can solve this using a combination of **UNION ALL** to aggregate both `requester_id` and `accepter_id` as "friend relationships" and then counting the total occurrences for each `id`.

#### **SQL Query 1 (Simple Approach)**

```sql
WITH cte AS (
    SELECT requester_id AS id
    FROM RequestAccepted
    UNION ALL
    SELECT accepter_id AS id
    FROM RequestAccepted
)
SELECT 
    id,
    COUNT(id) AS num
FROM 
    cte
GROUP BY 
    id
ORDER BY 
    num DESC
LIMIT 1;
```

#### **SQL Query 2 (Pre-Aggregation)**

Another approach involves pre-aggregating the counts of `requester_id` and `accepter_id` before combining:

```sql
WITH cte_cal AS (
    SELECT requester_id AS id, COUNT(requester_id) AS num
    FROM RequestAccepted
    GROUP BY requester_id
    UNION ALL
    SELECT accepter_id AS id, COUNT(accepter_id) AS num
    FROM RequestAccepted
    GROUP BY accepter_id
)
SELECT 
    id,
    SUM(num) AS num
FROM 
    cte_cal
GROUP BY 
    id
ORDER BY 
    num DESC
LIMIT 1;
```

---

### **Explanation**

#### **Step 1: Combine Friend Relationships**
- Use **UNION ALL** to combine `requester_id` and `accepter_id` into a single column. This captures all friendships for each user:
  ```sql
  SELECT requester_id AS id
  UNION ALL
  SELECT accepter_id AS id
  ```

#### **Step 2: Aggregate Friend Counts**
- Group by `id` and count occurrences to calculate the total number of friends for each user:
  ```sql
  SELECT id, COUNT(id) AS num
  FROM cte
  GROUP BY id
  ```

#### **Step 3: Identify the User with the Most Friends**
- Sort by `num` in descending order and limit the result to 1:
  ```sql
  ORDER BY num DESC
  LIMIT 1;
  ```

### **Output Example**

#### **Input**

**`RequestAccepted` Table**:

| requester_id | accepter_id | accept_date |
|--------------|-------------|-------------|
| 1            | 2           | 2016-06-03  |
| 1            | 3           | 2016-06-08  |
| 2            | 3           | 2016-06-08  |
| 3            | 4           | 2016-06-09  |

---

#### **Output**

| id  | num |
|-----|-----|
| 3   | 3   |

---

### **Explanation**

- User `3` is connected to `1`, `2`, and `4`, making them the user with the most friends.

---

### **Key Points**
- **UNION ALL** combines all relationships without removing duplicates.
- The **COUNT** function efficiently calculates the total connections for each user.
- Sorting and limiting ensures only the user with the most friends is returned.
