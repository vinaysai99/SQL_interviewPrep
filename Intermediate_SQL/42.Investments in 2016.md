### **42. Investments in 2016**

The task is to calculate the sum of all `tiv_2016` values for policyholders who meet the following conditions:  
1. Their `tiv_2015` value matches one or more other policyholders.
2. Their `(lat, lon)` location is unique (no other policyholder has the same `(lat, lon)`).

The result should be rounded to two decimal places.

---

### **Problem Details**

#### **Input Table**
- **`Insurance`**:
  - `pid`: Unique policy ID.
  - `tiv_2015`: Total investment value in 2015.
  - `tiv_2016`: Total investment value in 2016.
  - `lat`: Latitude of the policyholder's city.
  - `lon`: Longitude of the policyholder's city.

#### **Output**
- A single column `tiv_2016` representing the sum of qualifying policyholders' `tiv_2016` values.

---

### **SQL Query**

#### **Solution**

```sql
SELECT ROUND(SUM(tiv_2016), 2) AS tiv_2016
FROM Insurance
WHERE tiv_2015 IN (
    SELECT tiv_2015
    FROM Insurance
    GROUP BY tiv_2015
    HAVING COUNT(*) > 1
)
AND (lat, lon) IN (
    SELECT lat, lon
    FROM Insurance
    GROUP BY lat, lon
    HAVING COUNT(*) = 1
);
```

### **Explanation**

#### **Step 1: Filter Policyholders with Duplicate `tiv_2015`**
- Use a **subquery** to find `tiv_2015` values that appear more than once:
  ```sql
  SELECT tiv_2015
  FROM Insurance
  GROUP BY tiv_2015
  HAVING COUNT(*) > 1
  ```

#### **Step 2: Filter Policyholders with Unique Locations**
- Use another **subquery** to identify unique `(lat, lon)` pairs:
  ```sql
  SELECT lat, lon
  FROM Insurance
  GROUP BY lat, lon
  HAVING COUNT(*) = 1
  ```

#### **Step 3: Combine Conditions**
- Include both conditions in the `WHERE` clause:
  - `tiv_2015` must be in the list of duplicate `tiv_2015` values.
  - `(lat, lon)` must be in the list of unique locations.

#### **Step 4: Aggregate and Round**
- Use `SUM(tiv_2016)` to calculate the total investment value for qualifying rows.
- Round the result to two decimal places using `ROUND`.

### **Example**

#### **Input**

| pid | tiv_2015 | tiv_2016 | lat | lon |
|-----|----------|----------|-----|-----|
| 1   | 10       | 5        | 10  | 10  |
| 2   | 20       | 20       | 20  | 20  |
| 3   | 10       | 30       | 20  | 20  |
| 4   | 10       | 40       | 40  | 40  |

---

#### **Output**

| tiv_2016 |
|----------|
| 45.00    |

---

### **Explanation**

1. **Condition 1: Duplicate `tiv_2015`**:
   - `tiv_2015 = 10` is shared by `pid = 1`, `3`, and `4`.

2. **Condition 2: Unique `(lat, lon)`**:
   - `(lat, lon)` for `pid = 1` is `(10, 10)` (unique).
   - `(lat, lon)` for `pid = 4` is `(40, 40)` (unique).

3. **Qualifying Records**:
   - `pid = 1` (`tiv_2016 = 5`) and `pid = 4` (`tiv_2016 = 40`).

4. **Sum**:
   - `5 + 40 = 45.00`.

---

### **Key Points**
- **`HAVING` clause**: Filters grouped results to find duplicate or unique values.
- **Subqueries**: Allow filtering based on group-level conditions.
- **`ROUND` function**: Ensures the result is rounded to two decimal places.
