### **Department Top Three Salaries**

The problem is to identify employees with the top three unique salaries for each department and return the department name, employee name, and salary.

---

### **Problem Details**

#### **Input Tables**

1. **`Employee` Table**:
   - `id`: Employee ID.
   - `name`: Employee name.
   - `salary`: Employee salary.
   - `departmentId`: Foreign key referencing `id` in the `Department` table.

2. **`Department` Table**:
   - `id`: Department ID.
   - `name`: Department name.

#### **Output**
- Columns: `Department`, `Employee`, `Salary`.
- Include all employees with salaries in the **top three unique salaries** for each department.

### **SQL Query**

```sql
SELECT 
    res.Department,
    res.Employee,
    res.salary
FROM (
    SELECT 
        d.name AS Department,
        e.name AS Employee,
        e.salary,
        DENSE_RANK() OVER (
            PARTITION BY e.departmentId 
            ORDER BY e.salary DESC
        ) AS rnk
    FROM Employee e
    JOIN Department d 
    ON e.departmentId = d.id
) res
WHERE res.rnk <= 3;
```

---

### **Explanation**

#### **Step 1: Join `Employee` and `Department` Tables**
- Use an `INNER JOIN` to combine `Employee` and `Department` tables on the `departmentId` key.
- This provides the department name alongside each employee's details.

```sql
FROM Employee e
JOIN Department d 
ON e.departmentId = d.id
```

---

#### **Step 2: Rank Salaries Within Each Department**
- Use `DENSE_RANK()` to rank salaries within each department (`PARTITION BY e.departmentId`) in descending order (`ORDER BY e.salary DESC`).
- `DENSE_RANK()` ensures that employees with the same salary receive the same rank.

```sql
DENSE_RANK() OVER (
    PARTITION BY e.departmentId 
    ORDER BY e.salary DESC
) AS rnk
```

---

#### **Step 3: Filter Top Three Salaries**
- Select only rows where the rank (`rnk`) is `<= 3` to include employees with the top three unique salaries for their department.

```sql
WHERE res.rnk <= 3
```

---

#### **Step 4: Select and Format Output**
- Select the department name, employee name, and salary from the filtered results.
- Alias intermediate results with `res` for clarity.

### **Example**

#### **Input**

**Employee Table**:
| id | name  | salary | departmentId |
|----|-------|--------|--------------|
| 1  | Joe   | 85000  | 1            |
| 2  | Henry | 80000  | 2            |
| 3  | Sam   | 60000  | 2            |
| 4  | Max   | 90000  | 1            |
| 5  | Janet | 69000  | 1            |
| 6  | Randy | 85000  | 1            |
| 7  | Will  | 70000  | 1            |

**Department Table**:
| id | name  |
|----|-------|
| 1  | IT    |
| 2  | Sales |

---

#### **Output**

| Department | Employee | Salary |
|------------|----------|--------|
| IT         | Max      | 90000  |
| IT         | Joe      | 85000  |
| IT         | Randy    | 85000  |
| IT         | Will     | 70000  |
| Sales      | Henry    | 80000  |
| Sales      | Sam      | 60000  |

---

### **Explanation**

1. **IT Department**:
   - Top 3 unique salaries: `90000`, `85000`, `70000`.
   - Employees: Max (`90000`), Joe (`85000`), Randy (`85000`), Will (`70000`).

2. **Sales Department**:
   - Top 2 unique salaries: `80000`, `60000` (only two employees in this department).
   - Employees: Henry (`80000`), Sam (`60000`).

---

### **Key Concepts**
- **`DENSE_RANK()`**: Ensures proper ranking for employees with the same salary.
- **`PARTITION BY`**: Segments the ranking by department.
- **`INNER JOIN`**: Combines tables based on a common key.
